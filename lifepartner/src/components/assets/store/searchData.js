I found my match within a week. We interacted a bit on Shaadi.com, once it clicked in the first conversation, we took it forward and connected on phone calls. After that, we informed our parents about our relationship and fixed up a meeting The day we met I fell in love with her and she also felt the same. It was a Yes on the first date itself and then quickly the dates for Tilak Ceremony and Engagement got fixed. I feel so lucky that I met my soulmate here. For me, Punam was the girl I met on Shaadi.com and our worlds met so perfectly that I did not explore more options on the platform. On the final note, I just want to say Relationships are meant to be forever and ours is for the next 7 lives All Credit to LifePartner.com Cheers !!"},
